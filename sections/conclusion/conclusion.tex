\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we describe the use of camera movement and surrounding scene appearance as cues for action recognition.
Our method is the first to incorporate information about global camera motion as a feature for recognition,
which is shown experimentally to enhance recognition performance in multiple benchmarks. We have also
revisited the use of scene appearance as a feature for action recognition. We show that even a weak foreground/background
segmentation can provide more reliable features related to the surrounding scene compared to the previous
standard practice of using features from the entire frame. We highlight that the use of our camera motion and scene appearance
features in combination with standard motion features that focus on the foreground regions
can lead to state-of-the-art performances when coupled with the simplest classifiers
and encodings used in the current literature.
We expect that more sophisticated modeling frameworks would also be able to leverage our proposed feature extraction
process to further improve the current action recognition performance.
